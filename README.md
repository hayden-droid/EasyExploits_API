# How does the EasyExploits_API Work?
The EasyExploits_API uses both Lua and LuaC for it to inject and execute code. What happens is that the actual DLL is downloaded for it to actually Inject into the "RobloxPlayerBeta.exe" Program.

The EasyExploits_API redirects you to their website after injecting, and also shows a Start UI when it's fully injected.

# What Programming Language is the EasyExploits_API coded in?
The EasyExploits_API is coded in "C#", Also known as CSharp. This is because C# is more easier for people who are beginning to code. People who are advanced at coding make their own API in "C++".

# Who Decompiled the API?
The person who Decompiled the EasyExploits_API is Ghostedoryx. Ghostedoryx helped Decompile the EasyExploits_API by Reverse Engineering the code to get a new version of the actual code.

Everything was beautified so the code does not get messy when u try to edit the code.
